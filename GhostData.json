You can see design in everything starting from your coffee in the morning to the plushness of your bed at night. My search for a definition was fruitless because design is such an integral part of everything around us.

I have attempted to list some below,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><strong><em>Design is Art. Design is beautiful. Design is creativity. Design is useful. Design is making things better. Design is Emotion.

So, what can be judged as a good design. I have just two points on this,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;\">1. Good design is about the user and not the designer. According to iA's Oliver Reichenstein, <a title=\"Good design is invisible\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/24/3177332/ia-oliver-reichenstein-writer-interview-good-design-is-invisible\" target=\"_blank\">Good design is invisible</a>.. And his vision is to “Reduce to the essence.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;\">2. Good design creates <a title=\"beautiful solutions\" href=\"https://medium.com/design-ux/c4be733141f1\" target=\"_blank\">beautiful solutions</a> that work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is purely a compilation of my opinions and perception on what design is based on my research conducted through Genius Google.

I have attempted to list some below,</p>  \n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><strong><em>Design is Art. Design is beautiful. Design is creativity. Design is useful. Design is making things better. Design is Emotion. Design is Simple, Clear and Efficient.</em></strong></span></p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After going through a plethora of information, I perceive<em> Design as the interpretation of an idea to create anything which is useful</em><strong><em>. </em></strong>And, that anything can literally be anything from your mobile to a missile, your business card to a blockbuster movie, your tweet to a greeting card or even your breakfast to a bus time-table.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Design is useful and beautiful at the same time. Design is not the glossy surface but it is the underlying effort which makes the content and form to work together creating an illusion of effortlessness.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With knowledge comes the need to judge and that set me to think about good design. So, what can be judged as a good design. I have just two points on this,</p>  \n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;\">1. Good design is about the user and not the designer. According to iA's Oliver Reichenstein, <a title=\"Good design is invisible\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/24/3177332/ia-oliver-reichenstein-writer-interview-good-design-is-invisible\" target=\"_blank\">Good design is invisible</a>.. And his vision is to “Reduce to the essence.”</p>  \n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;\">2. Good design creates <a title=\"beautiful solutions\" href=\"https://medium.com/design-ux/c4be733141f1\" target=\"_blank\">beautiful solutions</a> that work.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is purely a compilation of my opinions and perception on what design is based on my research conducted through Genius Google. I encourage you to comment and express your views on the same.</p>","image":null,"featured":1,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1370200951000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1396091822492,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1370200951000,"published_by":1},{"id":8,"uuid":"276f93a4-d7be-4ebd-b8b4-84222d84ee62","title":"Code Conquest","slug":"codeconquest","markdown":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are anything like me and want to become a web developer, I have a very valuable resource to suggest.. <a title=\"Code Conquest\" href=\"http://www.codeconquest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Code Conquest</a>.

You can find most of the links I found useful in the <a title=\"Scroll down to References Section\" href=\"#references\">Reference</a> section, towards the bottom of this post.<!--more--></p>\n——————————♥——————————\n<h2>Elements of Design</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elements of design are the basic building blocks which are used to create the design.</p>\n\n<h3>Line</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A line is the continuous movement of a point along a surface. A line is a mark between 2 points. There are various types of lines, from straight to squiggly to curved and more. Lines can be used for a wide range of purposes like stressing a word, connecting content to one another, creating patterns and much more. Line is the element of art that is used to define shape contours and outlines. Line may be a continuous mark or may be implied by the edges of shapes and forms. Line has many different characteristics and may be thick or thin, long or short, and curved or straight.</p>\n\n<h3>Space</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The distance or area around, between or within components of the design is called space. Space falls into two categories: positive space and negative space. Positive space refers to the area that a shape or form occupies. Negative space is the space around the object. Both negative and positive spaces play an important role in design.</p>\n\n<h3>Texture</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is the surface quality or feel and can be tactile or implied. Texture is the surface quality of an object. There are two categories of texture: real texture and implied texture. Real texture refers to how the object would feel if it was touched. Implied texture refers to something that has been made to look as if it has texture through drawing or painting techniques (ie: a drawing of a tree with rough looking bark).</p>\n\n<h3>Shape/Form</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shape/Form gives definition to the objects. Shape is the element of design that occurs when a line intersects itself or another line to enclose a space. Three-dimensional shapes are called forms. Both shape and form can be either geometric or organic.</p>\n\n<h3>Colour/ Value</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is used to draw attention and can invoke mood or emotion. Colour is described with the words hue, value and intensity. Hue refers to the name of the colour, value is the lightness/darkness of the colour and intensity is the amount of saturation in the hue.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">——————————♥——————————</p>\n\n<h2>Principles of Design</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Principles of design are the laws used to create the design using some or all of the relevant elements.</p>\n\n<h3>Unity</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unity is the organization of the elements and principles into a cohesive and pleasing whole design or composition.</p>\n\n<h3>Balance</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Balance is the weighted relationship between the visual elements. Balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance refers to an item that looks the same on both sides of a line drawn through the center. Asymmetrical balance is when an item creates a feeling of equal weight on both sides even though they do not look the same.</p>\n\n<h3>Rhythm</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rhythm is the repetition of an element to achieve movement in a composition. It allows the eye to move from one part of a design to another part.</p>\n\n<h3>Proportion</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Proportion refers to the relationship between one part of a design to another. It is a comparison of sizes, shapes and quantities.</p>\n\n<h3>Emphasis</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Emphasis refers to the focus of attention in the composition. It is the quality that draws the viewer's attention to a certain part of the design.</p>\n\n<h3>Similarity and Contrast</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An effective use of contrast enables you to add interest to your design by highlighting specific graphic elements. This will result in a more visually striking composition. To achieve this 'contrast' is employed as a means of creating a visual hierarchy among different graphic elements. It can be applied to graphic elements, as light, dark, warm, cool, large, small; etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contrast is most effective when it is strong; the focal point of a design is usually a result of contrast where the eyes will naturally be drawn. Here contrast can be used to direct the focus of a composition. When used as a device to emphasize or highlight design elements it is important to remember that an ineffective use of contrast may result in confusion.</p>\n\n<h3>Proximity</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principle of proximity calls for related items to be grouped visually, creating less clutter and making for a more organized layout. Items unrelated to each other should be placed further apart, to emphasize their lack of relationship.</p>\n\n<h3>Hierarchy</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hierarchy arranges elements to create focal points by positioning their priority within a concept as a whole.</p>\n——————————♥——————————\n<h2 id=\"references\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">References</span></h2>\n<div>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.johnlovett.com/test.htm\">http://www.johnlovett.com/test.htm</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/design-elements/#more-1714\">http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/design-elements/#more-1714</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.usask.ca/education/coursework/skaalid/theory/cgdt/designtheory.htm\">http://www.usask.ca/education/coursework/skaalid/theory/cgdt/designtheory.htm</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/element.htm\">http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/element.htm</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.paper-leaf.com/blog/2011/02/elements-of-design-quick-reference-sheet/\">http://www.paper-leaf.com/blog/2011/02/elements-of-design-quick-reference-sheet/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.candcsigns.com/blog/elements-and-principles-design\">http://www.candcsigns.com/blog/elements-and-principles-design</a>\n\n</div>\n——————————♥——————————\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, What do you think?</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elements and principles of design that I have listed here are basically what I have ended up with by comparing numerous sources.

And, what better way to spend a hot afternoon than sipping an icy pomintea (Ooh, That is my latest experiment in the kitchen, DM me for a recipie :) ) and reflecting on my journey thus far.<!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can hear your mind buzzing about my choice of post title. Coding is fine.. But, Cloning? Before you get carried away, definitely not the biotechnological type. This is more of the Thinkful kind, where you apply what you have learnt to recreate well-known websites.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, That is what I have been doing for the past 3 weeks with Thinkful. The experience and progress thus far has been great. To understand what I am talking about, you need to check out this comprehensive <a title=\"Thinkful FEWD Review\" href=\"http://www.jcollado.es/blog/2013/12/20/thinkful-fewd-course-review/\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> by Javier Collado who recently completed the Front-End Web Development Course. So far I have learnt and practiced,</p>\n\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<ul>\n\t<li>Deeper knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3</li>\n\t<li>Box model and Positioning</li>\n\t<li>Debugging with Developer tools</li>\n\t<li>Git and Version Control</li>\n\t<li>jQuery DOM Traversal &amp; Manipulation</li>\n\t<li>jQuery Event handling &amp; Interactions</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, That is just the beginning and the more awesome part was the mentor sessions and the very supportive Community. The Google plus community is very supportive. When you are stuck, you get immediate answers and feedback on your work from Moderators and Mentors.

And, what better way to spend a hot afternoon than sipping an icy pomintea (Ooh, That is my latest experiment in the kitchen, DM me for a recipie :) ) and reflecting on my journey thus far.<!--more--></p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can hear your mind buzzing about my choice of post title. Coding is fine.. But, Cloning? Before you get carried away, definitely not the biotechnological type. This is more of the Thinkful kind, where you apply what you have learnt to recreate well-known websites.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, That is what I have been doing for the past 3 weeks with Thinkful. The experience and progress thus far has been great. To understand what I am talking about, you need to check out this comprehensive <a title=\"Thinkful FEWD Review\" href=\"http://www.jcollado.es/blog/2013/12/20/thinkful-fewd-course-review/\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> by Javier Collado who recently completed the Front-End Web Development Course.

I would say these 3 months have been the ***most-productive*** in my learning journey. I have learnt a lot and I have a lot to show for it. Yes, My portfolio is live as of 15th March, 2014 [here](http://jeyakarthika.com/portfolio). \n\nIt has been a habit of mine to just sit back and reflect when ever I complete a big project. It kind of helps me to learn from my own experience. This way I am able to ***make new mistakes*** instead of the same old ones again. Sometimes it gives me insight into things like how I can be ***more productive***, things I could have done better, etc..\n\nSo, when [Aatash Patel](http://jeyakarthika.com/coding-cloning-3-weeks-with-thinkful/index.html#comment-1309588672) left a comment asking me to share my experience with ThinkFul, I thought I will take the time write out my reflections as a blog post so that more people can get an idea about the course.\n\nI will not go through the general course structure and how it works because, Javier Collades has already given a very comprehensive review on his blog. You can read it [here](http://www.jcollado.es/blog/2013/12/20/thinkful-fewd-course-review/). This will be more about why I did the course, how it helped me, & the challenges I faced along the way.\n\n---\n\n##Why I chose ThinkFul?\nI was not a complete beginner nor was I new to programming. So, why did I do it? I have been self-learning for atleast 3 months. I was not even sure if I was absorbing anything I was learning. \n\n>I felt like I knew most of the pieces of the puzzle but didnt't know which piece to start with nor how to put them together as a whole. \n\nThat's when I realized I needed someone to guide me a little bit and point out where I go wrong and nudge me in the right direction. \n\nBasically, ***I needed a mentor and a course to structure my learning.*** While searching, I coundn't find any dev bootcamps or course providers who are located in brisbane. That's when I found thinkful, and liked the fact that it covered all my requirements. \n\n>By choosing ThinkFul, I got a Structured Learning, Weekly Mentor Sessions, Flexible learning options and a  Supportive Community, all with in a small budget.\n\n---\n\n##What have I learnt?\n\nOn the technical front,\n\n* HTML5\n* CSS3\n* Javascript\n* jQuery\n* AJAX/JSON\n* Git and\n* Design Fundamentals\n\nBut, more importantly, to put the puzzle together from start to finish. I have learnt to,\n\n* plan the website before coding\n* make design decisions\n* create good user experiences\n* observe object-oriented coding practices\n* practice commenting the code\n* identify cross-browser issues\n* create responsive websites\n* use devtools to identify and fix issues\n\n---\n\n##Projects Completed with ThinkFul\nThe projects I have completed as part of this ThinFul Course are linked below so that you can get an idea of what you can achieve with a ***project-based progressive learning.***\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/gClone/index.html\" title=\"gClone\" target=\"_blank\">\n![](/content/images/2014/Mar/gclone.png)\n</a>\n<div class=\"reference\">\n<strong>gClone</strong>\n<p>A clone of the google home page.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/sClone/index.html\" title=\"sClone\" target=\"_blank\">\n![](/content/images/2014/Mar/sclone.png)\n</a>\n<div class=\"reference\">\n<strong>sClone</strong>\n<p>A clone of the old 37 Signal's home page.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/sRevisited/index.html\" title=\"sRevisited\" target=\"_blank\">\n![](/content/images/2014/Mar/srevisited.png)\n</a>\n<div class=\"reference\">\n<strong>sRevisited</strong>\n<p>A clone of the old 37 Signal's home page revisited with jQuery hover effects and automatically updating day of the week.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/hotORcold/index.html\" title=\"Hot or Cold\" target=\"_blank\">\n![](/content/images/2014/Mar/hotORcold.png)\n</a>\n<div class=\"reference\">\n<strong>Hot or Cold</strong>\n<p>Number Seeking game with HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript.

Time\nWorking full-time left me only a couple of hours everynight and the weekends for my use. So, I ended up adding a recurring alert to learn web development for atleast 2 hours each day. \n###2. Commitment\nThere were days when I just wanted to relax after a full day's work and not to get back to learning. On those days I relaxed a bit and did some design inspiration browsing and reading latest tech news, blogs, etc..\n###3. Perfection\nI have a trait which pushes me to do nothing short of perfection. I had to learn that its okay to sometimes just leave the project imperfect and move on to learn the next thing.\n###4. Making Mistakes\nI was afraid to make mistakes initially. I tend to work on it until I felt there were no bugs at all before posting it to the forum for feedback. But, I have started accepting the fact that it is alright to make mistakes mainly because the community is very supportive and everyone tries to help each other and the mentors do not judge but provide constructive feedbacks, suggestions and pointers to resolve or improve your code.\n###5. Learning new things\nI love learning new things. But, it is always harder to get started. I managed that by supplementing ThinkFul resources with Tree House, Code school, reading blogs or books or watching videos. I allow myself time for the new concept to sink in. \n\nDiscussing with my Mentor, [Sunil Williams](https://plus.google.com/106018988588816920156/) was the best course of action in these cases because he will explain those concepts in simple terms. If I went and read up on the concept after, it will make a lot more sense.\n\n---\n\n##How to make the best of it?\n###1. Be Curious\nI guess I have already given you a fair idea of what you could be learning in the course but, as Darrell Silver [says](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/interview-with-darrell-silver-founder-of-thinkful), Thinkful tries \n>to inspire students to expose the curiosity that they have.\n\nThe more curious you are, the more you will be able to get out of this course. \n\n###2. Use the mentor sessions wisely. \nYou are literally having access to an experienced industry professional who is willing to help you learn. \n\nMy mentor, [Sunil Williams](https://plus.google.com/106018988588816920156/) gave me insights into his freelancing life, projects and how he debugs issues with his code, etc.. I was able to observe how he works logically on complex pieces of codes. \n\nMy sessions pretty much always went outside the curriculum and we discuss the concepts or the technologies I heard/read about that week and he introduces me to new stuff I could integrate to my code and at the end of the session gives me a summary of our discussions and all the new tools and resources he shared with me. This gives me something to refer back and keep in track of what I need to do and learn that week.\n\n###3. Practice\nFor each project try and implement atleast one new piece of technology that you don't understand yet. That way, you will be able to understand and get a complete grasp of that technology by the time you finish the project. And, only when you practice, you will learn more.\n\n###4. Learn the design unit in paralel\nI would recommend doing the design component in parallel with the other components so that you can use those concepts when you plan for each project. This way when you do your portfolio, you will be familiar with the design process and you can do the best design to showcase all your projects.\n\n---\n\n##Why should you go for it?\n\nIn summary, I would really recommend Thinkful because you get the following,\n\n>1. Syllabus\n2. Mentors\n3. Community & Office Hours\n4. Budget\n5. Project-based learning\n6. Progressive learning\n7. Good for newbies\n8. Flexibility\n\nThis is the type of course where ***you can only learn as much as you want to. It will be more or less based on the type of commitment and passion you have.***\n\nSo, yeah go for it. You will not regret it.\n\n---\n\nWow! This could be the longest post I have ever written. But, I really wanted to cover the questions that have been put forward to me. I am willing to answer any specific questions you might have regarding my learning journey with ThinkFul. Just leave a comment below or hit me up on [twitter](http://twitter.com/ItsJkTweeting).","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Mar/coding.png\" alt=\"featureimage\" /></p>\n\n<p>Hello folks, My 3 months of cloning &amp; coding with ThinkFul's Front-End Web Development course has come to an end. I would say these 3 months have been the <strong><em>most-productive</em></strong> in my learning journey. I have learnt a lot and I have a lot to show for it. Yes, My portfolio is live as of 15th March, 2014 <a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.com/portfolio\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It has been a habit of mine to just sit back and reflect when ever I complete a big project. It kind of helps me to learn from my own experience. This way I am able to <strong><em>make new mistakes</em></strong> instead of the same old ones again. Sometimes it gives me insight into things like how I can be <strong><em>more productive</em></strong>, things I could have done better, etc..</p>\n\n<p>So, when <a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.com/coding-cloning-3-weeks-with-thinkful/index.html#comment-1309588672\">Aatash Patel</a> left a comment asking me to share my experience with ThinkFul, I thought I will take the time write out my reflections as a blog post so that more people can get an idea about the course.</p>\n\n<p>I will not go through the general course structure and how it works because, Javier Collades has already given a very comprehensive review on his blog. You can read it <a href=\"http://www.jcollado.es/blog/2013/12/20/thinkful-fewd-course-review/\">here</a>. This will be more about why I did the course, how it helped me, &amp; the challenges I faced along the way.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"whyichosethinkful\">Why I chose ThinkFul?</h2>\n\n<p>I was not a complete beginner nor was I new to programming. So, why did I do it? I have been self-learning for atleast 3 months. I was not even sure if I was absorbing anything I was learning. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I felt like I knew most of the pieces of the puzzle but didnt't know which piece to start with nor how to put them together as a whole. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's when I realized I needed someone to guide me a little bit and point out where I go wrong and nudge me in the right direction. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, <strong><em>I needed a mentor and a course to structure my learning.</em></strong> While searching, I coundn't find any dev bootcamps or course providers who are located in brisbane. That's when I found thinkful, and liked the fact that it covered all my requirements. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By choosing ThinkFul, I got a Structured Learning, Weekly Mentor Sessions, Flexible learning options and a  Supportive Community, all with in a small budget.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"whathaveilearnt\">What have I learnt?</h2>\n\n<p>On the technical front,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HTML5</li>\n<li>CSS3</li>\n<li>Javascript</li>\n<li>jQuery</li>\n<li>AJAX/JSON</li>\n<li>Git and</li>\n<li>Design Fundamentals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But, more importantly, to put the puzzle together from start to finish. I have learnt to,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>plan the website before coding</li>\n<li>make design decisions</li>\n<li>create good user experiences</li>\n<li>observe object-oriented coding practices</li>\n<li>practice commenting the code</li>\n<li>identify cross-browser issues</li>\n<li>create responsive websites</li>\n<li>use devtools to identify and fix issues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"projectscompletedwiththinkful\">Projects Completed with ThinkFul</h2>\n\n<p>The projects I have completed as part of this ThinFul Course are linked below so that you can get an idea of what you can achieve with a <strong><em>project-based progressive learning.</em></strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"container\">  \n<a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/gClone/index.html\" title=\"gClone\" target=\"_blank\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Mar/gclone.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</a>  \n<div class=\"reference\">  \n<strong>gClone</strong>  \n<p>A clone of the google home page.</p>  \n</div>  \n\n<p></div></p>\n\n<div class=\"container\">  \n<a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/sClone/index.html\" title=\"sClone\" target=\"_blank\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Mar/sclone.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</a>  \n<div class=\"reference\">  \n<strong>sClone</strong>  \n<p>A clone of the old 37 Signal's home page.</p>  \n</div>  \n\n<p></div></p>\n\n<div class=\"container\">  \n<a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/sRevisited/index.html\" title=\"sRevisited\" target=\"_blank\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Mar/srevisited.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</a>  \n<div class=\"reference\">  \n<strong>sRevisited</strong>  \n<p>A clone of the old 37 Signal's home page revisited with jQuery hover effects and automatically updating day of the week.</p>  \n</div>  \n\n<p></div></p>\n\n<div class=\"container\">  \n<a href=\"http://jeyakarthika.github.io/ThinkFul/projects/hotORcold/index.html\" title=\"Hot or Cold\" target=\"_blank\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Mar/hotORcold.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</a>  \n<div class=\"reference\">  \n<strong>Hot or Cold</strong>  \n<p>Number Seeking game with HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript.

Time</h3>\n\n<p>Working full-time left me only a couple of hours everynight and the weekends for my use. So, I ended up adding a recurring alert to learn web development for atleast 2 hours each day.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2commitment\">2. Commitment</h3>\n\n<p>There were days when I just wanted to relax after a full day's work and not to get back to learning. On those days I relaxed a bit and did some design inspiration browsing and reading latest tech news, blogs, etc..  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3perfection\">3. Perfection</h3>\n\n<p>I have a trait which pushes me to do nothing short of perfection. I had to learn that its okay to sometimes just leave the project imperfect and move on to learn the next thing.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4makingmistakes\">4. Making Mistakes</h3>\n\n<p>I was afraid to make mistakes initially. I tend to work on it until I felt there were no bugs at all before posting it to the forum for feedback. But, I have started accepting the fact that it is alright to make mistakes mainly because the community is very supportive and everyone tries to help each other and the mentors do not judge but provide constructive feedbacks, suggestions and pointers to resolve or improve your code.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5learningnewthings\">5. Learning new things</h3>\n\n<p>I love learning new things. But, it is always harder to get started. I managed that by supplementing ThinkFul resources with Tree House, Code school, reading blogs or books or watching videos. I allow myself time for the new concept to sink in. </p>\n\n<p>Discussing with my Mentor, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106018988588816920156/\">Sunil Williams</a> was the best course of action in these cases because he will explain those concepts in simple terms.
