Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

(Believe it or not, it has been a mission impossible till date.) So, I got the Mailbox app and spent an entire evening swiping left and right. That's when I noticed this little something buried in the inbox. Nearly a month back, On the request of a friend preparing for CAPM, I prepared a list of tips from my experience to help her get through the exam. Thought it will be a good idea to post it here and help others who are thinking about taking up project management certification..<!--more--></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Certified Associate in Project Manager (CAPM)</strong></em> is awarded by the <em><strong><a title=\"PMI Website\" href=\"http://www.pmi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Management Institute</a> (PMI)</strong></em>. It recognizes the individual has a fundamental understanding of project management's process and terminology. This credential exemplifies your experience, education, and knowledge; increasing your recognition within an organization and around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"></h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to register for the CAPM exam?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <strong>CAPM Handbook</strong> guides you through the process and also gives you how the questions split-up based on the PMBOK topics. You can view it <a title=\"CAPM HAndbook - PMI Website\" href=\"http://www.pmi.org/certification/~/media/pdf/certifications/pdc_capmhandbook.ashx\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"></h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">General Exam Tips</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Get the PMBOK. Print out the Knowledge areas &amp; Process groups table. This is very important. Learn it completely.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Learn the inputs, tools &amp; techniques and outputs  for each of the 42 processes. Try to make a chart of that to refer to before the exam.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Download the <a title=\"CAPM HAndbook Link\" href=\"http://www.pmi.org/certification/~/media/pdf/certifications/pdc_capmhandbook.ashx\" target=\"_blank\">CAPM Handbook</a> and learn the PMI Code of Ethics &amp; Professional Conduct from Page 36 to 40. You will have questions from this.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. For questions on Code of ethics, If the ethics is violated, report them to the authorities, the value of the crime is never important, talk to the person, get the facts straight and only after that you should report. If your choices have check the rules or confirm with company policies, that is the right answer. If there is a choice of talk to the person, then that should be chosen than reporting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. The level of authority project managers have in different types of organizations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. Write down the formulas as soon as you sit down for the exam.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. If you feel that more than one answer is right choose the one which the project manager should do first, where applicable.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8. Always try to picture which knowledge area and process group the question belongs to before answering. It is advisable to draw a skeleton of the knowledge areas &amp; Process groups table after you write down the formulas. I found this to help me a lot during the exam.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9. Always answer the question from PMI's perspective. (some PMI'isms are listed below as a reference for you.)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10.Watch out for noise/distractors in the questions, ie., unnecessary data which distracts you from the question.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">11. Always read the question first. This will help you to cut through the noise/distractors quickly and arrive at the right answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"></h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Formulas</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>12.

(Believe it or not, it has been a mission impossible till date.) So, I got the Mailbox app and spent an entire evening swiping left and right. That's when I noticed this little something buried in the inbox. Nearly a month back, On the request of a friend preparing for CAPM, I prepared a list of tips from my experience to help her get through the exam. Thought it will be a good idea to post it here and help others who are thinking about taking up project management certification..<!--more--></p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Certified Associate in Project Manager (CAPM)</strong></em> is awarded by the <em><strong><a title=\"PMI Website\" href=\"http://www.pmi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Management Institute</a> (PMI)</strong></em>. It recognizes the individual has a fundamental understanding of project management's process and terminology. This credential exemplifies your experience, education, and knowledge; increasing your recognition within an organization and around the world.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"></h2>  \n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to register for the CAPM exam?</h2>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <strong>CAPM Handbook</strong> guides you through the process and also gives you how the questions split-up based on the PMBOK topics. You can view it <a title=\"CAPM HAndbook - PMI Website\" href=\"http://www.pmi.org/certification/~/media/pdf/certifications/pdc_capmhandbook.ashx\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"></h2>  \n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">General Exam Tips</h2>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Get the PMBOK. Print out the Knowledge areas &amp; Process groups table. This is very important. Learn it completely.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Learn the inputs, tools &amp; techniques and outputs  for each of the 42 processes. Try to make a chart of that to refer to before the exam.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Download the <a title=\"CAPM HAndbook Link\" href=\"http://www.pmi.org/certification/~/media/pdf/certifications/pdc_capmhandbook.ashx\" target=\"_blank\">CAPM Handbook</a> and learn the PMI Code of Ethics &amp; Professional Conduct from Page 36 to 40. You will have questions from this.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. For questions on Code of ethics, If the ethics is violated, report them to the authorities, the value of the crime is never important, talk to the person, get the facts straight and only after that you should report. If your choices have check the rules or confirm with company policies, that is the right answer. If there is a choice of talk to the person, then that should be chosen than reporting.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. The level of authority project managers have in different types of organizations.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. Write down the formulas as soon as you sit down for the exam.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. If you feel that more than one answer is right choose the one which the project manager should do first, where applicable.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8. Always try to picture which knowledge area and process group the question belongs to before answering. It is advisable to draw a skeleton of the knowledge areas &amp; Process groups table after you write down the formulas. I found this to help me a lot during the exam.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9. Always answer the question from PMI's perspective. (some PMI'isms are listed below as a reference for you.)</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10.Watch out for noise/distractors in the questions, ie., unnecessary data which distracts you from the question.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">11. Always read the question first. This will help you to cut through the noise/distractors quickly and arrive at the right answer.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"></h2>  \n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Formulas</h2>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>12.

By fundamentals, I mean the <strong><em>Elements and Principles of Design</em></strong>. By all means, this was the most confusing topic I have ever researched upon. Oh, the information available is plentiful. In fact, When I turned to Google for help, it gave me no less than 40, 100, 000 search results. But, the obstacle was to go through them and come up with my own conclusions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, this is merely my research notes after those long hours spent trying to make sense of what, why and how - about the elements and principles of design. You can find most of the links I found useful in the <a title=\"Scroll down to References Section\" href=\"#references\">Reference</a> section, towards the bottom of this post.<!--more--></p>\r\n——————————♥——————————\r\n<h2>Elements of Design</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elements of design are the basic building blocks which are used to create the design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Line</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A line is the continuous movement of a point along a surface. A line is a mark between 2 points. There are various types of lines, from straight to squiggly to curved and more. Lines can be used for a wide range of purposes like stressing a word, connecting content to one another, creating patterns and much more. Line is the element of art that is used to define shape contours and outlines. Line may be a continuous mark or may be implied by the edges of shapes and forms. Line has many different characteristics and may be thick or thin, long or short, and curved or straight.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Space</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The distance or area around, between or within components of the design is called space. Space falls into two categories: positive space and negative space. Positive space refers to the area that a shape or form occupies. Negative space is the space around the object. Both negative and positive spaces play an important role in design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Texture</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is the surface quality or feel and can be tactile or implied. Texture is the surface quality of an object. There are two categories of texture: real texture and implied texture. Real texture refers to how the object would feel if it was touched. Implied texture refers to something that has been made to look as if it has texture through drawing or painting techniques (ie: a drawing of a tree with rough looking bark).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shape/Form</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shape/Form gives definition to the objects. Shape is the element of design that occurs when a line intersects itself or another line to enclose a space. Three-dimensional shapes are called forms. Both shape and form can be either geometric or organic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Colour/ Value</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is used to draw attention and can invoke mood or emotion. Colour is described with the words hue, value and intensity. Hue refers to the name of the colour, value is the lightness/darkness of the colour and intensity is the amount of saturation in the hue.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">——————————♥——————————</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Principles of Design</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Principles of design are the laws used to create the design using some or all of the relevant elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Unity</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unity is the organization of the elements and principles into a cohesive and pleasing whole design or composition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Balance</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Balance is the weighted relationship between the visual elements. Balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance refers to an item that looks the same on both sides of a line drawn through the center. Asymmetrical balance is when an item creates a feeling of equal weight on both sides even though they do not look the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rhythm</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rhythm is the repetition of an element to achieve movement in a composition. It allows the eye to move from one part of a design to another part.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Proportion</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Proportion refers to the relationship between one part of a design to another. It is a comparison of sizes, shapes and quantities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Emphasis</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Emphasis refers to the focus of attention in the composition. It is the quality that draws the viewer's attention to a certain part of the design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Similarity and Contrast</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An effective use of contrast enables you to add interest to your design by highlighting specific graphic elements. This will result in a more visually striking composition. To achieve this 'contrast' is employed as a means of creating a visual hierarchy among different graphic elements. It can be applied to graphic elements, as light, dark, warm, cool, large, small; etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contrast is most effective when it is strong; the focal point of a design is usually a result of contrast where the eyes will naturally be drawn. Here contrast can be used to direct the focus of a composition. When used as a device to emphasize or highlight design elements it is important to remember that an ineffective use of contrast may result in confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Proximity</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principle of proximity calls for related items to be grouped visually, creating less clutter and making for a more organized layout.

By fundamentals, I mean the <strong><em>Elements and Principles of Design</em></strong>. By all means, this was the most confusing topic I have ever researched upon. Oh, the information available is plentiful. In fact, When I turned to Google for help, it gave me no less than 40, 100, 000 search results. But, the obstacle was to go through them and come up with my own conclusions.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, this is merely my research notes after those long hours spent trying to make sense of what, why and how - about the elements and principles of design. You can find most of the links I found useful in the <a title=\"Scroll down to References Section\" href=\"#references\">Reference</a> section, towards the bottom of this post.<!--more--></p>  \n\n<p>——————————♥——————————</p>\n\n<h2>Elements of Design</h2>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elements of design are the basic building blocks which are used to create the design.</p>\n\n<h3>Line</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A line is the continuous movement of a point along a surface. A line is a mark between 2 points. There are various types of lines, from straight to squiggly to curved and more. Lines can be used for a wide range of purposes like stressing a word, connecting content to one another, creating patterns and much more. Line is the element of art that is used to define shape contours and outlines. Line may be a continuous mark or may be implied by the edges of shapes and forms. Line has many different characteristics and may be thick or thin, long or short, and curved or straight.</p>\n\n<h3>Space</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The distance or area around, between or within components of the design is called space. Space falls into two categories: positive space and negative space. Positive space refers to the area that a shape or form occupies. Negative space is the space around the object. Both negative and positive spaces play an important role in design.</p>\n\n<h3>Texture</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is the surface quality or feel and can be tactile or implied. Texture is the surface quality of an object. There are two categories of texture: real texture and implied texture. Real texture refers to how the object would feel if it was touched. Implied texture refers to something that has been made to look as if it has texture through drawing or painting techniques (ie: a drawing of a tree with rough looking bark).</p>\n\n<h3>Shape/Form</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shape/Form gives definition to the objects. Shape is the element of design that occurs when a line intersects itself or another line to enclose a space. Three-dimensional shapes are called forms. Both shape and form can be either geometric or organic.</p>\n\n<h3>Colour/ Value</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is used to draw attention and can invoke mood or emotion. Colour is described with the words hue, value and intensity. Hue refers to the name of the colour, value is the lightness/darkness of the colour and intensity is the amount of saturation in the hue.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">——————————♥——————————</p>\n\n<h2>Principles of Design</h2>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Principles of design are the laws used to create the design using some or all of the relevant elements.</p>\n\n<h3>Unity</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unity is the organization of the elements and principles into a cohesive and pleasing whole design or composition.</p>\n\n<h3>Balance</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Balance is the weighted relationship between the visual elements. Balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance refers to an item that looks the same on both sides of a line drawn through the center. Asymmetrical balance is when an item creates a feeling of equal weight on both sides even though they do not look the same.</p>\n\n<h3>Rhythm</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rhythm is the repetition of an element to achieve movement in a composition. It allows the eye to move from one part of a design to another part.</p>\n\n<h3>Proportion</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Proportion refers to the relationship between one part of a design to another. It is a comparison of sizes, shapes and quantities.</p>\n\n<h3>Emphasis</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Emphasis refers to the focus of attention in the composition. It is the quality that draws the viewer's attention to a certain part of the design.</p>\n\n<h3>Similarity and Contrast</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An effective use of contrast enables you to add interest to your design by highlighting specific graphic elements. This will result in a more visually striking composition. To achieve this 'contrast' is employed as a means of creating a visual hierarchy among different graphic elements. It can be applied to graphic elements, as light, dark, warm, cool, large, small; etc.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contrast is most effective when it is strong; the focal point of a design is usually a result of contrast where the eyes will naturally be drawn. Here contrast can be used to direct the focus of a composition. When used as a device to emphasize or highlight design elements it is important to remember that an ineffective use of contrast may result in confusion.</p>\n\n<h3>Proximity</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principle of proximity calls for related items to be grouped visually, creating less clutter and making for a more organized layout. Items unrelated to each other should be placed further apart, to emphasize their lack of relationship.</p>\n\n<h3>Hierarchy</h3>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hierarchy arranges elements to create focal points by positioning their priority within a concept as a whole.</p>  \n\n<p>——————————♥——————————</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">References</span></h2>  \n\n<div>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.johnlovett.com/test.htm\">http://www.johnlovett.com/test.htm</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/design-elements/#more-1714\">http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/design-elements/#more-1714</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.usask.ca/education/coursework/skaalid/theory/cgdt/designtheory.htm\">http://www.usask.ca/education/coursework/skaalid/theory/cgdt/designtheory.htm</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/element.htm\">http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/element.htm</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.paper-leaf.com/blog/2011/02/elements-of-design-quick-reference-sheet/\">http://www.paper-leaf.com/blog/2011/02/elements-of-design-quick-reference-sheet/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.candcsigns.com/blog/elements-and-principles-design\">http://www.candcsigns.com/blog/elements-and-principles-design</a>\n\n</div>  \n\n<p>——————————♥——————————</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, What do you think?</h4>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elements and principles of design that I have listed here are basically what I have ended up with by comparing numerous sources.
